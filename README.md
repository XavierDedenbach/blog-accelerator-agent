# Blog Accelerator Agent

An AI-powered tool for accelerating research and review of blog content.

## Project Overview

The Blog Accelerator Agent automates deep research and multi-layered review processes while preserving human authorship for ideation and writing. The agent operates in two primary modes:

1. **Research Mode**: Performs exhaustive topic research including industry analysis, solution evaluation, paradigm assessment, and visual asset collection.
2. **Review Mode**: Conducts a three-stage review process (factual, style, and grammar) with user approval gates.

## Current Status

**Note (May 4, 2025)**: The project is currently undergoing final integration fixes for Task 4 (Researcher Agent Integration Improvements). All component tests are passing individually, but there are some indentation issues in the main `researcher_agent.py` file that need to be resolved before the full test suite will pass. Individual components (IndustryAnalyzer, SolutionAnalyzer, ParadigmAnalyzer, AudienceAnalyzer, and VisualAssetCollector) have been tested and are working correctly.

### Next Steps to Fix Integration Issues

1. **Fix Indentation in `researcher_agent.py`**:
   - Line ~180: Properly indent the SourceValidator initialization
   - Line ~188: Fix FirecrawlClient initialization indentation
   - Line ~250: Fix VisualAssetCollector initialization indentation
   - Line ~1515: Fix the nested try statement in process_blog method

2. **Run Tests Component-by-Component**:
   - Test individual analyzers: `pytest tests/test_*_analyzer.py`
   - Test visual asset collector: `pytest tests/test_visual_asset_collector.py`
   - Test researcher agent: `pytest tests/test_researcher_agent.py`

3. **Run Full Test Suite**:
   - Run all tests: `pytest tests/`
   - Fix any remaining issues

Once these issues are resolved, the researcher agent will be fully integrated and ready for deployment with all components working together seamlessly.
