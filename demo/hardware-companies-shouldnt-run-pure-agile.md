# Hardware Companies Shouldn't Run Pure Agile

## Introduction

Hardware companies face unique challenges when implementing agile methodologies. While software teams can deploy updates quickly and iterate based on feedback, hardware development involves physical components, manufacturing processes, and longer cycle times.

## The Traditional Approach

Traditionally, hardware development has followed waterfall or stage-gate processes, with extensive planning and design before any physical prototyping begins. This approach minimizes costly retooling but can be slow to adapt to changing requirements.

## Problems with Pure Agile for Hardware

Applying pure agile methodologies to hardware development presents several challenges:

- Physical prototypes take time and money to produce
- Manufacturing setup has high fixed costs
- Supply chain dependencies create delays
- Regulatory requirements often demand comprehensive documentation upfront
- Hardware mistakes are more costly to fix than software bugs

## A Hybrid Approach

Instead of pure agile, hardware companies should consider a hybrid approach that:

1. Uses agile principles for planning and team collaboration
2. Maintains appropriate documentation for compliance and manufacturing
3. Focuses sprints on design iterations rather than finished products
4. Leverages simulation and rapid prototyping where possible
5. Adapts timelines to account for physical constraints

## Conclusion

While agile principles offer valuable improvements to traditional hardware development processes, a pure agile approach isn't suitable for most hardware companies. A thoughtful hybrid methodology that acknowledges the unique constraints of hardware development will yield better results.
